<h2>Introduction</h1>

<p>Hello, <b>World</b>!!

<p>1a You can override a built-in implicit rule (or one you have defined
yourself) by defining a new pattern rule with the same target and
prerequisites, but different commands.  When the new rule is defined,
the built-in one is replaced.  The new rule's position in the sequence
of implicit rules is determined by where you write the new rule.
You can cancel a built-in implicit rule by defining a pattern rule
with the same target and prerequisites, but no commands.  For example,
the following would cancel the rule that runs the assembler:

You can cancel a built-in implicit rule by defining a pattern rule

the following would cancel the rule that runs the assembler:

<ul>
<li>foo
<ol>
<li>food
<li>foot
</ol>
<ul>
<li>food
<li>foot
</ul>
<li>bar
</ul>
